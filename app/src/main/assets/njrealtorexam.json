        "details":" All of the above are true regarding commissions. Once a broker receives the commission earned, they must disperse the agent's portion of commission as soon as possible and within 10 days of receipt. The procuring cause refers to the person who caused the sale to take place. Just because you showed someone a property does not mean that you automatically earned your commission and they may end up buying it from another agent. But if you can prove that you were integral in convincing the buyer to purchase that particular property and they made the decision while working with you, you may be able to prove procuring cause and collect the commission. And most listing agreements contain a broker protection clause which usually gives 90 days protection after a listing expires. This provision protects the brokers commission if a buyer was shown the property, and expressed an interest, but decided after the listing expired to purchase the property. As long as an interested buyer list was given to the seller before the listing expired, the broker will be protected and be paid the commission. If any of those buyers successfully negotiate and complete a sale on that property, the seller will pay the commission to the former listing broker. This is to stop sellers from taking the buyer aside and knowing the listing will expire, offering them a reduced price if they buy the house directly from the seller after the listing expires. This clause becomes void if the seller lists the property with a new broker. ",
