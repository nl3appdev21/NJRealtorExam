You also cannot act as an attorney because you are not licensed to do so. Never say no, or \"yes, you must\". Explain that while some people are comfortable not using a lawyer, buying a home is a complicated process and, should any problems arise, an attorney could prove to be of significant value. This must be a decision they make themselves, with you answering their questions carefully and honestly."

    "correct":3,
    "details":" Just attempting to do any of the listed activities without being licensed can land you in serious trouble. Foreclosures are first put to auction at the county courthouse and if not sold, they are foreclosed upon by the lender and can be sold in an online auction run by companies who employ licensed agents. An owner can collect rent from his own tenant, but he cannot hire someone to do it for him unless they are actively licensed by the state. An owner holding a mortgage for the buyer of his property can specify the terms he wants in the loan but the mortgage document would be drawn by an attorney. Should the buyer ask for your assistance in negotiating the loan with the seller, you need to be familiar with terms, rates and other facets of the transactions. A seller may want to discuss what rate he should charge and how long he should hold the loan. You need training and experience to render this assistance. If you are not sure of something you may have your broker assist, or have the attorney who will prepare the mortgage documents the advice. "
